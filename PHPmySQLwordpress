# Things that are highly specific to what you need to do for the webhost

# in browser --->   www.yourwebsite.com/phpmyadmin           lets you log into your phpmyadmin

# wordpress.org/download         I'll document how to do from terminal at a later date
# tar -xvf wordpress.tar.gz
# find wordpress folder then     sudo cp -r * /var/www/yourwebsite.com           this copies all wordpress things to your website
# sudo rm index.html (you want only index.php) 

# IMPORTANT
# When changing IP Address of webhost find function.php within your theme you are using for wordpress /var/www/yourwebsite.com/wp-content/themes/thetheme
# update_option( 'siteurl', 'NEW IP ADDRESS' );
# update_option( 'home', 'NEW IP ADDRESS' );
# In /etc/apache2/apache2.conf        add           ServerName 127.0.0.1       this removes could not reliably determine server's fqdn 
# What worked at the end of the day, not sure if the rest of this worked, I'll try again when I have to switch to my home network. Was changing the value---
# in wp_options siteurl and home
